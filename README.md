______
**Due Date** : Month dd, yyyy @ hh:mm am/pm
- _Assignment submission will be verified by the timestamps noted in the repository log_

**Goal** : Gain basic skills required in using Git for a shared codebase, as well as an initial understanding of GitHub Project Board capabilities.

**Piazza** : Feel free to post questions, observations, and tips to Piazza. _Do not post solutions_.

**Description** :	This Assignment is designed as an introductory exercise for NCSU GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Project Boards, and Git command sequences. There are several steps to this assignment and you are encouraged to complete them in sequence. Each of the tools introduced in this assignment will be used in this course. By the end, you should feel comfortable with applying the basics of these in future homework and projects.

**Notes** :
- For reference, a folder with example screenshots of steps can be 
accessed [here](link).
- Assignment tips can be viewed [here](link).

_______

**SetUp** :
1. Sign into [NCSU’s GitHub](https://github.ncsu.edu/)
- _If you have never accessed your NCSU GitHub account, a first time login with your NCSU unity id and password is all that is needed to set up the service._
2. Create a _private_ repo:
- Name it **CSC_ECE_517_Assignment1** and select the option to “initialize this repository with a README”.
3. Add the instructor and all TAs as collaborators using their Unity IDs.
```Bash
settings → collaborators
```
4. Watch the [GitHub Project Introduction Screencast](link).
- This presentation contains specific information about how to complete the remainder of this assignment.
5. Create a new private GitHub Project **(via the project tab of your repo)**
- Name it **CSC_ECE_517_Assignment1**
- Select the _Basic Kanban_ template, and link your assignment repository.
- You can set up your Project Board Columns in a variety of ways. Your board **must** include a _ToDO_, _InProgress_, and _Done_ column. You may reference the following [Project Board](https://github.com/carmenbentley/Assignment0/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen) as a template.
________
**GitHub Project Boards** :
- _Create Project issues/tasks for each of the following, moving them appropriately through the kanban board columns ToDo → InProgress → Done, and closing the issue when completed._
- **Note**: as stated in the above presentation, GitHub Project Board Issues are also known as Tasks. Issues are a generalized card on the Project Board that can represent an item that needs to be completed, fixed, reconsidered, etc.
1. Issue 1
- **Label**: Assignment1 Todo
	- _This [new label](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-label) should be created__.
- **Assignees**: You are responsible for completing this Issue,a assign yourself to the task.
- **Description**: Complete all the levels in the following “Main” topics of the Git Tutorial
		- (1) Introduction Sequence
		- (2) Ramping Up
		- (3) Moving Work Around
		- (4) A Mixed Bag
	- Once you have completed each of the levels required for this task, you should have learned the basics for understanding important git commands and sequences that will be helpful when completing group assignments using a shared code base, such as committing code, merging conflicts, branching, etc.
2. Issue 2
- **Label**: Assignment1 Todo
- **Assignees**: You are responsible for completing this Issue, assign yourself to the task.
- **Description**: Add a screenshot named _completedGitLevels.png_ to your CSC_ECE517_Assignment1 repository that captures your progress of the tutorial mentioned in Issue 1. This image will serve as evidence that you have completed the 
levels required. It will also give you an opportunity to experience adding files to your NCSU GitHub Repository. Below you will see an example screenshot of what your image should look like.
