**Assignment Instructions** :
1. Sign into [NCSU’s GitHub](https://github.ncsu.edu/)
- _If you have never accessed your NCSU GitHub account, a first time login with your NCSU unity id and password is all that is needed to set up the service._
2. Create a _private_ repo:
- Name it **CSC_ECE_517_Assignment1** and select the option to “initialize this repository with a README”.
3. Add the instructor and all TAs as collaborators using their Unity IDs.
```Bash
settings → collaborators
```
4. Watch the [GitHub Project Introduction Screencast](link).
- This presentation contains specific information about how to complete the remainder of this assignment.
5. Create a new private GitHub Project **(via the project tab of your repo)**
- Name it **CSC_ECE_517_Assignment1**
- Select the _Basic Kanban_ template, and link your assignment repository.
- You can set up your Project Board Columns in a variety of ways. Your board **must** include a _ToDO_, _InProgress_, and _Done_ column. You may reference the following [Project Board](https://github.com/carmenbentley/Assignment0/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen) as a template.
________

Create Project issues for each of the following, moving tasks appropriately through the kanban board ToDo → InProgress → Done, and closing the issue when completed.
	Note: as stated in the above presentation, GitHub Project Board Issues are also 
known as Tasks. Issues are a generalized card on the Project Board that can 
represent an item that needs to be completed, fixed, reconsidered, etc.
