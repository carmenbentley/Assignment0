# Using GitHub Project Boards for Team Projects

_Below you will find a series of suggested steps to help you and your team get started and incorporate GitHub Project Boards into your group assignments. GitHub Projects is meant to help your team with planning, organization, communication, and tracking. Remember that everyone's Project Board will have slight variations as teams determine a format that is most appropriate for their members._
___________
1. **Create a GitHub repository** :
- Have one member of your team create a GitHub repo and add each teammate as a collaborator.
2. **Additional Collaborators** :
- Add any TAs or Mentors to your Github repo that you would like to allow access for commenting, tracking, and planning assistance.
3. **Create a Github Project Board** :
- Create an associated Project Board _via your GitHub repository_.
4. **Format Project Board** :
- Create columns that are most appropriate for your team.
- For example, you may find the following columns useful:
  - **Backlog**: tasks that have been created but not yet assigned
  - **Current Sprint**: tasks to be completed during this week of work (or sprint)
  - **In Progress**: tasks that are currently being developed
  - **Review**: tasks that are completed and ready for team review
  - **Done**: tasks that have been completed and reviewed by team
5. **Initial Project Reading** :
- Read, in full, the Project description before your first group meeting making note of any tasks that you believe necessary to successfully complete the project.
6. **First Group Meeting** :
- Schedule an initial group meeting where you do the following:
  - Determine a regular meeting time.
  - As a suggestion, making each meeting a task can act as a reminder and provide evidence of your meeting.
  - An even better form of documentation is to add a .md or .txt file to your repo that houses a meeting agenda, important discussion that occurred and even topics to cover at the next meeting.
  - Discuss the overall project.
    - What is the end goal of the project?
    - What patterns are to be implemented?
    - Are there any provided use cases?
    - What are the necessary tasks to successfully complete the project?
    - Can these tasks be divided into smaller, more manageable tasks?
    - etc.
7. **Create a list of tasks and insert into Project Board** :
- Short term: tasks to be completed before the next meeting.
- Long term: tasks to be completed by the end of the project timeline.
8. **Assign appropriate labels and descriptions** :
  - Remember that you can assign multiple labels to each issue.
9. **Assign tasks to group members** :
- All group members should be assigned tasks so that project development is evenly distributed amongst the team.
10. **Notice the “weight” and/or “complexity” of tasks** as you are assigning them to members so that the workload can be evenly distributed.
11. **Ask your mentor to take a look at your Project Board** _(suggestion)_
- Your mentor may be able to provide feedback on your list of tasks. 
  - “Are they appropriately divided?” 
  - “Are there tasks that might be missing?”
  - etc.
12. **Task Work Cycle** :
- When you are working on your assigned task(s), be sure to move the ticket through the work cycle
- (example: backlog → in progress → in review → complete)
13. **Plan Additional Group Meetings** : _at least once a week_
- At each additional group meeting, be sure to do the following:
- Check the progress of your Project Board.
- Make comments and/or update current tasks.
- Add additional tasks if necessary.
- Reassign tasks if necessary.
14. **Assign new task**:
- Remember to keep tasks evenly distributed across your teammates.
15. **Maintain the Board** :
- Actively document work and move tasks as you are working.
